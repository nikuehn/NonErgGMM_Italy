# A Comparison of Nonergodic Ground-Motion Models for Italy

This repository contains code and figures to reproduce most of the analyses in Kuehn (2021), "A Comparison of Nonergodic Ground-Motion Models for Italy".
The files "vcm_italy_inla" contain R-code to read the data, and calculate the spatial INLA models.
They also contain code to perform some comparisons, and plot results.
The files "vcm_italy_msgwr" calculate results for the msgwr method.
